# 3GL
A simple 2D/3D game framework/library written in [Zig](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) using [Sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol).

Highly experimental and limited, still in the initial phases of development.

Any contributions would be greatly appreciated!

## Usage
Fetch Sokol tools binary build by running the `fetchDeps.ps1` script before running `zig build shaders` to compile all shaders and `zig build run` to run the project.
